# Better Tab Cycle Chrome Extension

↔ Go back and forward between last tabs in the current window. Useful if you have more then one monitor. 

⌨ Adjust Key bindings in keyboard settings.

Behavior: 
- If on current tab for more then 1 second it will reset cycling and puts current tab to top of history stack.
- Only cycles inside the focused window.
